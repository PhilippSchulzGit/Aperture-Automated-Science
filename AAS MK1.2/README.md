This is the third revision of the program for Aperture Automated Science (AAS) and implements the sound output for dialogues.

You will need the following libraries in order to run it:
CMU
jSApi
jSerialComm
jUnit
Pi4J

Adding the libraries is done by copying the above mentioned folders from the root library folder in the GitHub repository into the "lib" folder of this program revision.

You will also need to copy over the folders 'audio' and 'CMUSphinx' from the 'resources' folder from root into this program revisions folder. Please keep the files in the program revisions folder if any conflicts arise.
(this way, I can save storage space because the audio files and the language model for the voice recognition are quite large).
