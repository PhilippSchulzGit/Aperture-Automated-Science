Update:
As of July 2nd 2022, the project folder structure has been changed. You will now need to collect the required libraries from the library folder.
This was done to avoid storage problems as I plan to upload many more revisions of this program.
Each program revision now comes with an own README where all required libraries are listed. simply copy them from the library folder in this projects root into the program revisions "lib" folders on your device.

As of July 11th 2022, the project folder structure has been changed again. This time, you will need to copy parts from the 'resources' folder into the program revisions folders.
Refer to the README in the individual program revisions for which resources have to be copied.
The reason for this change is simply to avoid a lot of storage space being occupied for duplicate files.
