This is the first revision of the program for Aperture Automated Science (AAS) and implements the fundamental structure of the program.

You will need the following libraries in order to run it:
CMU
jSApi
jSerialComm
jUnit
Pi4J

Adding the libraries is done by copying the above mentioned folders from the root library folder in the GitHub repository into the "lib" folder of this program revision.
Note that *none* functionality from all those libraries is actually implemented, but prepared for what I will use them for. You can also simply delete all usages in the program and skip all libraries.

You will not need to copy any resources, as all required ones are already in the program revisions folder.
